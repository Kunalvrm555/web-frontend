The monthly art prompt for September is ‘Paint-demic’ with the purpose of using art to support the well being of our student community.\n          \n          We are looking for artworks depicting the importance of the Covid protocols, the dangers of the virus or healthy habits amidst a pandemic. The most creative artworks will be put up at various locations on campus to invigorate the spirits of students staying there and spread awareness regarding the rules set in place. The best artworks would be displayed by Gymkhana on Facebook.\n          \n          All sorts of artworks are appreciated, paintings, digital or traditional, sketches, posters, comics etc. Use any medium of your choice.\n          Good luck to all the participants!\n          Stay safe everyone!`,\n    ],\n    links: [\n      {\n        description: \"Rules are available here:\",\n        href: \"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-0VHjfGnvaUcXcoZSrqz5a3HbZVAl4JDGu7BUp8NaxU/edit\",\n        content:\n          \"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-0VHjfGnvaUcXcoZSrqz5a3HbZVAl4JDGu7BUp8NaxU/edit\",\n      },\n      {\n        description: \"Please submit your artworks here at:\",\n        href: \"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfB6mZ3T7WrQrgXLMPy_YmVeau87INZIU-Gmd3bW62w1XxX2w/viewform?usp=sf_link\",\n        content:\n          \"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfB6mZ3T7WrQrgXLMPy_YmVeau87INZIU-Gmd3bW62w1XxX2w/viewform?usp=sf_link\",\n      },\n    ],\n    isHighlight: false,\n  },\n];\nexport default eventsData;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport Styles from \"../../styles/components/Navbar/Notification.module.css\";\n\nexport default function Notification({ event, handleClick }) {\n\n  const notifStyle = {\n    position: 'relative',\n    padding: '1rem',\n    margin: '0.75rem auto',\n    width: '95%',\n    borderRadius: '0.25rem',\n    backgroundColor: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)',\n    cursor: 'pointer',\n    boxSizing: 'border-box',\n    transition: 'all 0.3s ease',\n  }\n  return (\n    <div className={Styles.notification} style={notifStyle} onClick={() => handleClick()}>\n      <div>\n        <span className={Styles.title}>\n          {event.title}\n          <span\n            className={`material-icons ${Styles.closeIcon}`}\n          >\n            close\n          </span>\n        </span>\n      </div>\n      <div className={Styles.description}>\n        {event.description}\n      </div>\n      <div\n        className={Styles.createdTime}\n      >\n        {event.createdAt}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n","import React, { useState, useEffect } from \"react\";\nimport NotificationsIcon from \"@material-ui/icons/Notifications\";\nimport { NavLink } from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport Badge from \"@material-ui/core/Badge\";\nimport Styles from \"../../styles/components/navbar.module.css\";\nimport useNavbar from \"./useNavbar\";\nimport eventsData from \"../Events/eventsData\";\nimport Notification from \"./Notification\";\nimport { useHistory } from \"react-router-dom\";\n\nexport default function Navbar() {\n  //using Custom Hook useNavbar for logic of navbarClass\n  const navbarClass = useNavbar();\n  const [click, setClick] = useState(false);\n  const [notification, setNotification] = useState({\n    badgeContent: 0,\n    click: false,\n  });\n  const handleClick = () => setClick(!click);\n  const highlightEvents = eventsData.filter((event) => event.isHighlight);\n  // console.log(highlightEvents);\n  let listClass;\n  if (click) {\n    listClass = `${Styles.navMenu} ${Styles.active}`;\n  } else {\n    listClass = `${Styles.navMenu}`;\n  }\n  const handleNotificationClick = () => {\n    if (!notification.click) {\n      setNotification({ badgeContent: 0, click: true });\n    } else {\n      setNotification({ badgeContent: 0, click: false });\n    }\n  };\n  const history = useHistory();\n  const handleNotiClick = () => {\n    history.push(\"/events\");\n  };\n  useEffect(() => {\n    setNotification({ badgeContent: highlightEvents.length, click: false });\n  }, [highlightEvents.length]);\n\n  return (\n    <div className={navbarClass}>\n      <nav className={Styles.navbar}>\n        {/* Navbar logo */}\n\n        <div className={Styles.navLogo}>\n          <NavLink to=\"/\" style={{ display: \"flex\", alignItems: \"center\" }}>\n            {\" \"}\n            <img src=\"/data/media/images/general/gymkhanaLogo.png\" alt=\"KGP_logo\" />\n            <span>&nbsp;TSG</span>\n          </NavLink>\n        </div>\n\n        {/* Menu icon on smaller devices */}\n\n        <div className={Styles.menuIcon} onClick={() => handleClick()}>\n          <i className={click ?
